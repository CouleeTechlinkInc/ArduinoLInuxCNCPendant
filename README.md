# ArduinoPendant

This is an arduino LinuxCNC Pendant inspired by http://www.mgware.co.uk/LinuxCNC/arduino-pendant.html ( but no resued code because I like mit better then gpl )

Parts of the project
* Arduino Code
* Pendant Hardware design
* LinuxCNC plugin ( probably based on comp )
* Serial protocahl for talking between pendant and linuxcnc 
 
The arduino is going to be based on the atmega 32u4 because it gives us 13 interupt pins and built in usb
